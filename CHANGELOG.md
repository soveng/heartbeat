## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Adapted Heartbeat for Sovereign Engineering projects and
  `heartbeat.sovereignengineering.io`.
- Replaced static repo YAML files with a GitHub-backed import from the
  Sovereign Engineering website project catalog.
- Added grouped filters for SEC cohorts and the public `soveng` GitHub org.
- Switched the fork to Bun-only install, test, build, fetch, and deployment
  commands.
- Made Appwrite the canonical hosted deployment provider and moved legacy
  deployment-provider config out of the active branch.
- Switched scheduled refreshes to the Appwrite VCS deployment API.
- Kept search URLs compact by deriving matches from `?q=` instead of serializing
  every query-matched repo into `?repos=`.

### Added

- Bun CI quality gates for formatting, tests, typecheck, lint, and production
  build.
- Fetch health checks that fail unhealthy GitHub refreshes before writing a new
  dataset.
- Catalog coverage metadata for source, project count, skipped links, empty
  groups, and group counts.
- Initial timeline row cap with a show-more control for large event feeds.
- Hosted deployment smoke checks for the generated activity feed, OpenGraph
  image, and security/cache headers.

### Documentation

- Documented the fork branch workflow, upstream remote policy, Bun gates, and
  deployment settings.

## [Upstream 0.1.0] - 2026-04-29

This section records the inherited OpenSats Heartbeat release history for
provenance.

First tagged release. Heartbeat is a static activity dashboard that renders
commits, PRs, issues, and releases for a curated set of GitHub repos as a
`git log --oneline`-style timeline. Data is fetched at build time and served
as a static JSON file, so visitors never hit the GitHub API directly.

### Added

- Timeline view with per-event-type sigils, colors, and short ids.
- Clickable short ids: commit hashes, `#PR`/`#issue` numbers, and release
  tags link straight to GitHub.
- Click a repo name or username inside an event row to filter the timeline
  by that repo or dev.
- Repo lists are loaded from grouped `repos.*.yml` files (one per fund)
  and merged on build.
- Filter bar with chip-based filters for fund, repo, type, and dev.
- Live `filter:` textbox that auto-selects matching repos as you type,
  with debounced URL writes for snappy typing on large repo lists.
- `?q=` URL param prefills the filter textbox so links are shareable;
  matching repos are re-selected on load.
- Fund-level filter with row label and lowercase fund names derived from
  the filename.
- Collapsible repos row with a `show all <n>` / `<n> selected` summary
  chip and a clear shortcut.
- Click the brand mark / "heartbeat" title to reset every filter.
- Footer line summarizing unfiltered totals by event type, plus a
  `repo missing? create a PR` invite.
- Sticky filter bar and sticky day headers on desktop.
- Mobile-tuned layout: condensed metadata line, truncated dev name,
  hidden commit hashes, and a `└─` prefix on wrapped titles.
- OpenGraph and Twitter card metadata for rich link previews.
- Vercel build script (`vercel-build`) and a scheduled GitHub Action
  (`refresh.yml`) that pings a Vercel deploy hook every 6 hours.

### Changed

- `actor` filter renamed to `dev` end-to-end: row label, internal naming,
  and URL param (`?actors=` → `?devs=`).
- Filter input restyled to match chip buttons and moved below the repo
  chips; row labels aligned to a fixed-width column.

### Performance

- `EventRow` is memoized and click handlers are stabilized so timeline
  re-renders stay cheap as filters change.
- Filter-driven work is deferred via `useDeferredValue` and the
  query-to-repos auto-select is debounced to coalesce history writes.
